# Sigfox Face Recognition Using OpenCV and Raspberry Pi

<p><strong>Install a fresh Raspbian image on your Raspberry Pi </strong></p><p>Download the latest image: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/</a></p><p>Install the image on your SD card.</p><p>The installation guide on the official Raspberry Pi website is well explained. You just have to follow the procedure whether you are on:</p><ul>
<li>Linux: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installa...</a>
</li><li>Mac: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installa...</a>
</li><li>Windows: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installa...</a></li></ul><p><strong>Configure your Raspberry Pi</strong></p><p>Once you have prepared your SD card with a fresh raspbian, just insert it in the Raspberry Pi and plug it. You might need to plug the Raspberry Pi onto a screen and add a mouse and a keyboard to configure it. If you have a Raspberry Pi 2, you also need an ethernet cable or a wifi usb adapter.</p><p>Now, the first thing you should do is connect your raspberry Pi to the internet and run in the terminal: </p><p>$ sudo apt-get update</p><p>$ sudo apt-get upgrade -y</p><p>$ sudo reboot</p><p><em>Note that the default password is "raspberry"</em></p><p>Now go the "Menu" -&gt; "Preferences" -&gt; "Raspberry Pi Configuration" and go the "Interfaces" tab</p><p>We need to enable:</p><p>- Camera<br>- SSH<br>- I2C</p><p><strong>Install OpenCV</strong></p><p>We are going to use the OpenCV python librarie. At first, I tried to compile it myself but I couldn't really make it. I spent hours trying different tutorials but with no success.</p><p>Finally I found that OpenCV could be installed using apt-get. I read that few features are missing but at least it is enough for what we want to do!</p><p>(<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=85755">https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f...</a>)</p><p>Open your terminal again and run:</p><p>$ sudo apt-get install python-dev</p><p>$ sudo apt-get install python-opencv</p><p>$ sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev</p><p><em>However, if you wish to compile it yourself, feel free to have a look at pyimage website: <a href="http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/02/23/install-opencv-and-python-on-your-raspberry-pi-2-and-b/">http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/02/23/install-op...</a></em></p><p><em>It can be a bit long though.</em></p><p><strong>Test the installation</strong></p><p>In your terminal run:</p><p><em>pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python<br>Python 2.7.9 (default, Mar  8 2015, 00:52:26)
